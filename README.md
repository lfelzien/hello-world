## hello-world
I am Leanne Felzien. I am a business process analyst at Micron Technology and have been employed there since 1990. I love to automate in excel, design databases, write SQL code, and write excellent reports. I have almost received the equivalent of a minor in Computer Science from BSU. 

I have **five** children (:boy: :girl: :girl: :girl: :girl:) and love being their mom! Three of my kids are computer scientists, one is a *graphic designer*, and my youngest is a senior in highschool. Believe it or not they have all been homeschooled.

A fun fact, I am quite musical and can play many instruments. I can play the piano, classical guitar, violin, and can sing. But, my major love is the cello. I even have an album!

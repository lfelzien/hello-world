# hello-world
I am Leanne Felzien. I am a business process analyst at Micron Technology and have been employed there since 1990. I love to automate and have almost received an equivalent minor in CS from BSU. I am a CS mom as I have 1 son graduated in Computer Science from BSU and two daughters currently enrolled in the BSU Computer Science department.

A fun fact, I am quite musical and can play many instruments. I can play the piano, guitar, violin, and can sing. But my major talent is the cello.
